 <h1> The Best Movies According to Syam</h1>

 <h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Mithunam</h3>
 <p>A simple movie which tells the tale of parents leading their oldage when kids grow and move to different places across the world. It is an art of showcasing true relationship.</p>
 <h3>Vedam</h3>
 <p>A movie which shows what a human can do for earning money and how they realise that money is not everything at the end. It's journey of three different individuals and their pursuit of life in different ways.</p>
 <h3>Batman: The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>I love the Bane character in this movie.</p>
